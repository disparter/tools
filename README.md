# Tools
	Tools to Help with general stuff (for example, naming a development branch)


	CODENAMEGEN

		All thanks to Tiago Ventura, who created this internal tool (as many others) to make easy a series of development tools.
		The CodenameGen is just a funny tool that pick a random NOUN and a random ADJECTIVE and put them together to generate a 	name, and list a lot of random names for you to pick.
		The nouns list, and the adjectives list are necessary to create the collection, and you can be creative using your own nouns and adjectives to mix substantial names for your project. FOR EXAMPLE: you can create a list of nouns with the Greek Gods, or with Car Names.
		
	BULKY RENAMER
	
		A bat script that performs recursive renaming for files in Windows.
		Usage: place de bat file in the folder that will have the files renamed
		renomeador.bat "OLD_PATTERN" "NEW_PATTERN" "file_type"
		Ex: renomeador.bat "_" "-" "docx" (will replace all underscores to hiphen in .docx files)
